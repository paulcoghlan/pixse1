Just after celebrating Christmas we left for Turin airport again to ski in Torgnon (a lesser known part of the Aosta Valley). The highlight was seeing in the New Year travelling to the Matterhorn on Europe's
highest cable car. We stopped at the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise for a very expensive lunch!

Sadly I forgot to bring my camera charger so most of these are iPhone photos.
