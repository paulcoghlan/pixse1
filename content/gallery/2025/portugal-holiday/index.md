We went away to stay at an apartment/hotel situated in a town called Lagos, in the Algave. There were many beautiful beaches nearby, notably Praia do Pinhao.
We also went on a speedboat trip to the Benagil Caves, which was an exciting (if bumpy) way to travel! Our final night was spent in Faro - we were lucky to find to a local food festival before we flew home the following day.
