- Hugo Theme [fork](https://github.com/paulcoghlan/hugo-theme-hello-friend) of https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend tailored towards hosting collections of photo galleries.
- Adds two types:
  - `gallery` - a set of images in directory
  - `collection` - group of galleries to be used as primary navigation
- The theme allows you to turn a hierarchy of photo directories into a static website with the aid of an
[import tool](https://github.com/paulcoghlan/hugo-gallery).
- Note this theme isn't intended to be for portfolio or blog sites, it more about making it easy to manage a large number of photo galleries.
- Gallery component is based on https://www.lightgalleryjs.com/ lightbox and https://miromannino.github.io/Justified-Gallery/ for the layout.
