## Content

The content is in the content/ directory.
When there is a new photo gallery to be added:

1. The gallery will be located in a content/gallery/<year>/<gallery-name> directory.
2. The gallery will have various jpeg photos and index.md file with the following front matter:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Gallery Title"
   date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
   type: "gallery"
   cover: "cover-image.jpg"
   tags: ['tag1', 'tag2']
   ---
   ```

   The `cover` field should be the filename of the cover image for the gallery from the same directory.
